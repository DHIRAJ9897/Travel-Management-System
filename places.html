		  <h1> 1.The Taj Mahal,Agra</h1>
		  <br><br>
		     <img src="image/tajmahal.jpg" alt="Trulli" width="500" height="333">
		       <P> Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the world's most famous testimony to the power of love.
            	  Named after Mumtaz Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan,
	             this most beautiful of mausoleums was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen until 1648 to complete.</P>
	           <P>Incorporating many elements of Islamic design including arches, minarets, an onion-shaped dome, and black calligraphy inlaid around
	               the entrance, the Taj Mahal is largely constructed of white marble. Adding to its splendor are delicate inlaid floral patterns and 
	               precious and semi-precious stones such as jade, lapis lazuli, diamonds, and mother of pearl.   </P>
	           <br>
	      <h1> 2. The Red Fort, New Delhi </h1>
		  <br><br>
             <image src="image/red.jpg" alt=" "width="500" height="333"> 
               <P>Built by Shah Jahan in 1648 as the seat of Mughal power – a role it maintained until 1857 – 
	        	the magnificent crescent-shaped Red Fort in New Delhi, named after the stunning red sandstone used in its construction,
		       covers a vast area of more than two square kilometers, all of it surrounded by a large moat.	</p>
              <P>Highlights include its two largest gates: the impressive Lahore Gate (the fort's main entrance) and 
	          the elaborately decorated Delhi Gate, once used by the emperor for ceremonial processions.	</P>	
	           <br>
	     <h1>3. Mumbai: The Gateway of India</h1>
		 <br><br>
	        <image src="image/gateway.jpg" width="500" height="333">
	         <p> Standing an impressive 26 meters tall and overlooking the Arabian Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a must-see when in Mumbai. 
	            Built to commemorate the arrival of King George V and his wife Queen Mary in 1911, this stunning piece of architecture was opened 
	            with much pomp and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a while, the tallest structure in the city.  </p>
	        <p>Constructed entirely of yellow basalt and concrete and notable for its Indo-Saracenic design, the Gateway of India was also the scene 
	          of a rather less jubilant procession of British soldiers in 1948 when India gained its independence. These days, the huge archway 
	           provides a stunning backdrop that is as popular among locals as it is tourists. </P>

		 <h1>4. Agra Fort </h1>
		 <br><br>
		    <image src="image/agra-fort.jpg"  width="500" height="333" >
			  <p> Built as a military structure in 1565 by Emperor Akbar with later additions by Shah Jahan, the stunning Agra Fort
			  (also known as Agra's Red Fort) is an interesting mix of both Hindu and Muslim influences. </P>
			  <p> Located a little more than two kilometers from the Taj Mahal, the fort is entered through Amar Singh Gate with its low outer wall 
			  and dogleg design built to confuse attackers. Once inside, you'll see two large interlinked sandstone buildings, 
			  Akbari Mahal and Jahangiri Mahal, the largest private residence in the complex.</p>

		 <h1>5. The Ellora Caves, Aurangabad </h1>
		 <br><br>
		     <image src="image/ellora-caves.jpg"  width="500" height="333" >
			  <p> The famous monumental Ellora Caves were built between the 5th and 10th centuries by Buddhist, Jain, and Hindu monks, and 
			  make for an excellent excursion from Mumbai, some 300 kilometers to the west. </p>
			  <p> Now a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this remarkable collection of 34 carved monasteries, chapels, and temples – 12 of them
			  Buddhist, 17 Hindu, and five belonging to the Jain faith – were built in close proximity to each other, a reflection of the religious 
			  tolerance that existed during this period of Indian history. </p>
			  <p>Of the Buddhist monastery caves, highlights include a number of shrines featuring carvings of Buddha and 
			  saints dating from the 5th to 7th centuries, as well as the stunning Carpenter's Cave, considered one of the finest in India. </P>
